## Description

The size and properties of interstellar space are often incorrectly perceived or understood, as a result of our struggle with comprehending extremely large or small things. Our goal is to build a program that helps users visualize extremely large distances in space, particularly between observed star systems.

## Model

#### Algorithms
The types of algorithms we used are...:
**WRITE THE ALGORITHMS USED FOR TRAVERSAL HERE**
1. Algo 1.
2. Algo 1.
3. Algo 2.

We chose these algorithms because...

#### Data Structure Reference

```cpp
class Graph {
	//These maps will make up our gra
	map<string, vector<pair<string, double>>> data;
};
```
An adjacency list allows quick access to the neighbors of the central vertex (the peripheral vertices), and it stores only the actual edges, making it much more efficient in terms of space than an adjacency matrix, especially for sparse graphs like star graphs.
